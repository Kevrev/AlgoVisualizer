## General Information

AlgoVisualizer is a web application that allows users to see a visual representation of popular data sortings algorithims in action in order to gain/demonstrate an understanding of how they operate. Users can change the size of the dataset, generate a new one, and pick from a series of sorting algorithims to sort with.

## Deployed Site

The deployed site can be found [here](https://kevrev.github.io/AlgoVisualizer/).

## Description

Users are given the ability to generate new random arrays along with the ability to change the size of the array they wish to sort. Each value in the array corresponds to the height of a 'block' shown in the visual representation. The currently included sorting algorithims are Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. The sorting operation is executed when one of the sort buttons is pressed.

When a sorting operation is in progress, the 'Stop Sorting' button will appear and all other buttons will be disabled until either the operation completes or the 'Stop Sorting' button is pressed. The array is maintained in its current orientation after sorting and can continue to be sorted once a sorting operation is selected again.
